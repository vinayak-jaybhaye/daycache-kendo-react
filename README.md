# DayCache - AI-Powered Digital Diary

DayCache is a modern digital diary that helps you record your thoughts, track your activities, and get AI-generated summaries of your day. With a sleek and intuitive interface, DayCache makes journaling effortless and enjoyable.

In this app I've mostly used Kendo-react components for UI.

## Features
- **Cache Chat** â€“ Ask about any day you've written about.
- **AI Summary** â€“ Automatically summarizes your daily entries.
- **Smart Autocomplete** â€“ Helps complete your journal entries smoothly.
- **Intuitive UI** â€“ Clean and minimal design for a distraction-free writing experience.
